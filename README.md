# Installation
To install and play Battleship, either clone the repo or download the source files in a ZIP file. Then, execute `lib/battleship_runner.rb` with Ruby to begin playing.

# Rules
One running, type `q` and press `ENTER` to begin the game. You will first be asked to input the coordinate of your ships. Input in the format `a1 b1 c1`, using a letter and a number separated by spaces without any punctuation.<br><br>
Once you have placed all ships, the game will begin. You will see your board with ships visible `S` and the enemy board with ships obscured. Enter a coordinate to fire upon. The board will update to reflect your shot. A `M` is a miss, a `H` is a hit. A series of `X` means the ship has been sunk.<br><br>
The game will end when either player loses all of their ships. You will be able to play a new game or quit the program.
